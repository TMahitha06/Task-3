**Objective**:

A password generator using Python aims to create strong, random passwords to enhance security and ensure compliance with complexity requirements. It also provides customization options for length and character types to suit various needs.


**Key Activities:**
 
**1. Set Up Environment**

*Import Required Libraries:* Use libraries such as random, string, and optionally secrets for cryptographic-level randomness.

**2. Character Set Definition**

*Create Character Pools:* Define which characters will be used in the password (e.g., letters, digits, punctuation).

*Handle Special Characters:* Optionally include special characters if needed for higher complexity.

**3. Password Generation Logic**

*Random Selection:* Implement logic to randomly select characters from the defined set.

*Password Length:* Allow customization of the password length.


**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**

A Python-based Password Generator can be built using the following technologies:

Password generators typically use programming languages like Python or JavaScript, alongside libraries such as `secrets` for secure random number generation. They also employ development tools like IDEs for coding and frameworks for user interfaces, if applicable.
